# CostRegisterMobile
A simple cost register app for mobile.

I already have a small CostRegister app (WPF) project and now I move it to Xamarin (mobile app).
The main functions of it will be:
- Saving your costs,
- Income,
- Planned costs (if you know that you will buy e.g. a new tv),
- Counting the actual balance with or without the planned costs,
- Showing the percentage of costs in differenct categories (e.g. food, household, sport, hobby)
In the future, I would like to add new functions to the app.
The datas are saved locally to a SQLite database file.

I would like to learn and practice the using of Xamarin.Forms. 
I would like to also learn how MVVM apps built in WPF or Xamarin, what are the differences between those desktop and mobile platforms.
